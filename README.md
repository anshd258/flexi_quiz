# Flexi Quiz

**Flexi Quiz** is a Flutter project designed to be flexible, utilizing modern packages like `freezed`, `retrofit`, and Firebase for efficient development. This project uses various tools for state management, network calls, logging, and more.

## Project Structure

### Key Packages Used:
- **Flutter SDK**: For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Freezed**: For immutable data classes and union types.
- **Retrofit**: For generating network request code.
- **Firebase**: For authentication, cloud storage, remote configuration, etc.
- **Provider**: For state management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Flutter installed. You can check by running:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Install dependencies by running:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Firebase Configuration

To integrate Firebase, follow these steps:

1. **Set up Firebase**: Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a project, and add Android/iOS apps.

2. **Firebase Initialization**: The project uses Firebase core services like authentication and Firestore. These services are initialized using `firebase_options.dart`, which is generated by Firebase CLI.
   
   **Note**: 
   - `firebase_options.dart` is included in `.gitignore` and needs to be generated locally by running:

   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

### Running the Build Runner

The project uses code generation for `freezed`, `retrofit`, and JSON serialization. To generate the required files (`.freezed.dart`, `.g.dart`, etc.), use:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Firebase Services

Ensure that Firebase is properly initialized by calling `Firebase.initializeApp()` with the appropriate options. This can be done using the generated `firebase_options.dart`.

```dart
import 'firebase_options.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

### Git Ignore

Certain generated files are ignored in version control to prevent conflicts and unnecessary commits. This includes:

- `*.freezed.dart`
- `*.g.dart`
- `firebase_options.dart`

Ensure you generate these locally using the commands above.

### Running the App

Once everything is set up, you can run the app on your desired platform by using the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Features

- **State Management**: Powered by `Provider` for efficient state handling.
- **Network Layer**: The project uses `retrofit` and `dio` for making network requests with ease.
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication and Firestore are set up for handling user data and cloud storage.
- **Custom Fonts**: Uses Google Fonts for custom typography.
- **Transition Animatoins**: Page Transitoins animations for better user experience

## Development Workflow

### 1. Code Generation:
For updating or regenerating the code after changing models or APIs, run:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will update the `freezed` and `g` files, ensuring that your data models and API services are up-to-date.



## Additional Tools Used

- **Talker**: For error and log handling, especially useful in debugging an special ison is added to hoge page for logs.
- **Cached Network Image**: For efficient image loading and caching.
- **Firebase Remote Config**: For managing feature flags and dynamic configurations.
